# Arithmetic

#### Introduction
A repository for the study of algorithms


#### Disclaimer

All the code in this repository is written by me while studying the basic templates for the Algorithmic Competition.
This repository contains some of the code templates involved in the algorithmic competition and the comments I made while practicing.

#### Outline

1. Basic algorithm templates
Such as: quick sort, subsumption sort, discretization, etc.
2. Data structure algorithm templates
Such as: single linked table, double linked table, heap and Tire tree, KMP with array simulation.
3. Search and graph theory algorithms
Such as: DFS, BFS, spfa, prim, etc.
4. Common mathematical knowledge in the application of algorithms algorithms
Such as: prime number, approximate number, Euler function, fast power, etc.
5. Dynamic programming DP part of the algorithm
Such as: backpack problem, linear DP, interval DP, tree DP, etc.
6. Greedy algorithms
Such as: Huffman tree, sorting inequality, absolute value inequality, etc.
